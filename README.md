                  Priority Readers and Writers
Write a multi-threaded C program that gives readers priority over writers concerning a shared (global) variable. Essentially, if any readers are waiting, then they have priority over writer threads -- writers can only write when there are no readers. This program should adhere to the following constraints:

Multiple readers/writers must be supported (5 of each is fine)
Readers must read the shared variable X number of times
Writers must write the shared variable X number of times
Readers must print:
The value read
The number of readers present when value is read
Writers must print:
The written value
The number of readers present were when value is written (should be 0)
Before a reader/writer attempts to access the shared variable it should wait some random amount of time
